## Why Do I Develop This App?

- This budget app is developped for the Pursuit 10.2 module 4 project.
- I, as a developer, want to build w/ simple function, and simple looking app.
- I have wanted to practice typescript.
- I have messed up w/ time schedule, but wanted to put more "fancy" stuff.

## How To Use

The main page will show total transection you have currently w/ a doughnut chart. It is based on the data from the back-end server.
Clicking income on the nav bar will guide you into the total income transection table. And clicking each table row will guide you to the detail about each item.
Item has 5 properties; item title, date, description, amount, source from whom.

Same rule is applied for the spending link on the nav bar.

clicking New entry will guide you for the new entry form for both income & spending; clicking the top left button to change income & spending mode.

To delete or Edit single item, you have to click them on the detailed page.

Clicking "SY's budget app" will guide you to the main page.
